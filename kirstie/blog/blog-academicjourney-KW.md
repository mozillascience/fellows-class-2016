# How I came to be a Mozilla Science Fellow

***Kirstie Whitaker***

***6th October 2016***

## Notes
Written at the end of the hour

* This is too long - maybe split into two posts
  * My academic journey <---- THIS FILE
  * My goals for the mozilla Fellowship

* Key take home points:
  * **Goal 1**: Release the NSPN data
    * Need to explain what the data is, why it is valuable to ourselves, why it is valuable to others.
    * Challenges: privacy, "scooping", usability (data is complex, analyses are complex, need lots of documentation!)
  * **Goal 2**: Bring 10 people into the Mozilla Science Lab community
    * Need to explain what community has done for me, why it's so great, why I want to create networks. Basically need to explain the motivation of the Mozilla Leadership Network. WOW and Open Leaders cohort too. MAYBE explain how I felt when I wasn't successful for fellowship last year.
    * Challenges: busy, not sure what it is, getting the word out!
  * **Goal 3**: Release code as a python package
    * Need to build up skills on how to take my scripts and make them into something others can install and use easily.
    * Challenges: new skill set, imposter syndrome.

Maybe flip goals 2 and 3 in the order? Might make more sense that way to go from imposter syndrome to community?

## Free writing

Ok - 1 hour of totally free writing.

My name is Kirstie and I'm a researcher in the department of psychiatry at the university of cambridge.

I study adolescent brain development, which means I put teenagers and young adults in MRI scanners and take pictures of their brains.

(Actually, that isn't true, I work in a large consortium of researchers and we have an amazing team of research assistants and radiographers who do the scanning!)

So what I do is sit at my laptop and take a look at the data. I don't think it's always really clear that a picture is just made up of lots of different pixels, and therefore a brain scan is a volume so we call the parts that make up the image "voxels".

All of those voxels have numbers associated with them, and that's my raw data.

Once I have that data I can analyse it in lots of different ways. I'm particularly interested in the brain's structure. One of the first steps I do is use some freely available (to academics) software (Freesurfer) to draw lines around the outside of the brain (the pia - in red) and the boundary between grey and white matter (yellow).

My undergraduate degree was in Physics, and all through school I really loved solving problems and I had great fun in my three years at the University of Bristol. In my final year I worked on a dissertation (a literature review) titled "Do Information Effects Cause Cancer". It was my first foray into applying my analytic skills to biological processes and I was hooked.

Based on how much I'd enjoyed reading papers in my final year that applied physical models and analyses to questions of human biology, I applied for a Commonwealth Fellowship to study in Canada.

(If I'm honest, I also really wanted to go skiing a lot!)

It was during my time at the University of British Columbia studying Medical Physics that I learned about Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Let me tell you: **MRI is absolutely incredible**. It's totally non-invasive (in contrast to x-rays for example) and you can use it to see different tissue types throughout the body.

I worked in Dr Alex Mackey's lab studying myelin. Myelin is the fatty sheath that surround the axons of neurons and it makes sure that the signals sent between these brain cells are clear and don't get lost on long journeys around the brain.

My studies at UBC lead me to apply for a Fulbright fellowship to study for a PhD in Neuroscience. I have to say, the orientation weekend for the 2007 UK Fulbright scholars is one of my favourite memories. It was definitely my first time thinking "Holy moly there must have been a clerical error here. These people are amazing!" But, we all kinda felt that way, and I'm so proud to be a member of the Fulbright family.

Fulbright fellowships forge links between the USA and the rest of the world. I took mine to the Helen Wills Institute of Neuroscience at the University of California at Berkeley. I studied for five years in Prof Silvia Bunge's lab and investigated the Neurodevelopemnt of Reasoning Ability. We asked children and teenagers to lie in MRI scanners and looked at their brains as they performed analogical reasoning tasks.

The best thing about my time in California was certainly the people I met and worked with. The Neuroscience Institute outdid themselves in selecting and recruiting the smartest and most passionate early career researchers. Everyone I know from my PhD is now doing incredible things, both within the traditional academic establishment, or from a plethora of other jobs.

And all this brings me to my current position as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Cambridge. I work with Prof Ed Bullmore in the Brain Mapping Unit which is part of the Department of Psychiatry. We're interested in understanding adolescent brain development, particularly in the context that so many young people experience their first episodes of depression or psychosis during their teenage years.

I work in the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network and we've collected a large number of MRI scans from our amazing volunteer participants. ***My primary goal for the next ten months as a Mozilla science fellow is to package, document and release that data for everyone to use.***

There are a couple of challenges with sharing MRI data. The first is that we're taking pictures of people's heads, and its important that we maintain the highest standards of confidentiality. There is lots of ethics paperwork within universities around the world. It can be a headache but it is of paramount importance, there have been horrific acts undertaken in the name of science in the past (REFS: syphilis, Nazis, Henrietta lacs) and we have to make sure that we keep our participants informed of what they're involved in, and maintain their privacy.

**But we do need to share the data.**

We're smart cookies here at the University of Cambridge, but we don't have all the ideas, we don't have all the answers, and we certainly don't have all the time we need to undertake the ones we have!

We've spent four years and Â£2 million on collecting, curating and analysing the MRI scans of these 300 young people. We're funded by the Wellcome Trust whose mandate is XXXX (something about doing good).

We're better together.


Other goals: ***Bring 10 people into the Mozilla Science Lab community as active members***.

I've benefited so much from being in the Mozilla Science lab community. Built up my confidence, restored my faith that science can change, made me feel hopeful that the next generation of leaders will go back to the way science was meant to be done AND work TOGETHER to make a positive change in the world.

**I really think that others will benefit just as much as I have, and I want to make that happen.**

I'm also passionate about making sure that Mozilla are connected to some of the incredible projects happening around the world. They are a great organisation and I want people to know about them.

Goal 3: ***Release my code as a python package***

I write a lot of code and I have done for years, but it's only in the last year (with the support, mentorship and encouragement of the Mozilla Science Lab team) that I've promoted my code and contributed to other FOSS (free and open source software) projects.

The main reason is imposter syndrome. I didn't learn any coding in my undergrad or masters, I'm completely self taught. I've never taken an (official) class in how to code and I always assumed that my code was rubbish and everyone else's was amazing.

I'm here from the future to tell you that is **completely not true**.

A) my code is actually very good. I was taught by an incredible woman who told me that 75% of my code should be comments. And while I wouldn't say I always get that high, I do hit about 50% most of the time. And now that I look at other people's code I see why that rule is so important!

B) We can stand on the shoulders of giants. So much of graduate school is reinventing the wheel! I have code that does almost exactly the same thing you want to do, so LET'S SHARE!

I'm very involved in Codebar: a non-profit that supporting women and members of under-represented (in science) groups to learn to code. Coding opens up so many doors, it saves you time, it means your work is reproducible and can be checked and used by others. And it is also where so many people experience imposter syndrome.


HOLY MOLY I'm tired. Needs some major editing and a re-focus because it's too long. But hopefully there's some good stuff to cut down here!

=== No need to bring reproducibility into it! ===

Did you know that when scientists publish their paper the vast majority don't show their working? I'm confident that almost all of them are working really hard and trying to achieve the best results they can, but it's very hard to reproduce their results if you don't have the data they used, and know exactly what they did in their analyses.
