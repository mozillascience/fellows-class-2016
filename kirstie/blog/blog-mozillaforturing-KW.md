# What is Open Science...and how can you get involved?

*By [Kirstie Whitaker](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research-fellows/), 2016/17 Mozilla Fellow for Science and Turing Research Fellow*

You've probably heard of [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/products/) - an open source web browser - and you may know that it is made by the folks at [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/). But that's where most people's experience with Mozilla ends.

I'm a current Mozilla Fellow for Science and I'd like to spend this time explaining a little about what I do, why I do it, and how you can get involved.

## Who are Mozilla?

The [Mozilla Foundation](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/) began [in 1998](https://air.mozilla.org/code-rush/) when it was all but certain that Microsoft had cornered the market for an individual's access to the Internet. They believed then, and still do, that the Internet should remain a global public resource that is [open and accessible to all](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/about/manifesto/).

## What does open source mean?

Firefox is a [free and open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) (FOSS) web browser. *Free* means that anyone is allowed to use it, and *open-source* means you can see all the code that powers the browser.

You're always welcome to contribute and update the code (if you have the expertise) and that's one reason FOSS projects are so good! If you stick with traditional [proprietary software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software) you can't see "under the hood" and therefore it is often slower to find problems and fix them.

## How does that relate to open science?

Open science is inspired by the open-source movement. It is the belief that we can build something together that is bigger than the sum of its parts, and better than we could achieve on our own.

There's a big white elephant in the room at the moment: the vast majority of published research is not reproducible. That means that when you read an article you can't check the scientists' work.

At the moment we share our results but not the data and code required to re-run the analyses by anyone else. We're slowing down the research process by making it harder for the next person to build on our findings, and - even worse - there can be little mistakes that lead to [great big errors](http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-reinhart-and-rogoff-controversy-a-summing-up) in interpretation.

## Better together

The [Mozilla Science Lab](https://science.mozilla.org/) is a community of researchers, developers and librarians making research open and accessible. They bring together a diverse group of people who want to [build tools](https://science.mozilla.org/projects) to make science faster, smoother and more transparent. We also support communities to support each other, and share [tips and tricks](https://science.mozilla.org/resources) on how to move from "closed" to open science.


## Get involved

Everyone is welcome to the Mozilla Science Lab. You can be a current researcher looking to [share or learn skills](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/studygroups) for making your work more transparent. You may be a developer who wants to work with scientists to come up with innovative ways of analysing or sharing their data.

Or you can be a [citizen scientist](https://www.britishscienceassociation.org/citizen-science) or [science communicator](https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2014/oct/10/science-communicators-quantum-physics-granny) who participate in and disseminate scientific findings to a broader community.

You can [subscribe](http://tinyletter.com/sciencelab) to the Mozilla Science lab monthly newsletter or join in any of their [events](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/events/). (Almost all of them are remote meaning you can join in from wherever you are around the world.)

## Our bi-monthly book club

On [Monday 20th February](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/events/bc-february-2016) we'll be sharing our thoughts on [Dear Data](http://www.dear-data.com/) by [Giorgia Lupi](http://giorgialupi.com/) and [Stefanie Posavec](http://www.stefanieposavec.co.uk/).

For one year, every week both authors/artists exchanged postcards betwen London and New York documenting their personal data. The book is a beautiful introduction to data visualisation and was awarded a gold medal by [Information is Beautiful](http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/2015/information-is-beautiful-awards-winners-2015/) in 2015.   

> "Starting small is how we hope to increase data literacy and further these conversations…But most importantly, this was a project where we put all of ourselves as human beings and designers into this radical experimentation: approaching the data we collected as snapshots of our days and lives…to discover with the most contemporary material, data." ~ Giorgia Lupi, Stefanie Posavec, [Dear Data Medium blog](https://medium.com/@giorgialupi/dear-data-has-been-acquired-by-moma-but-this-isnt-what-we-are-most-excited-about-bdaa3376d9db#.jeip21tpy)

You can read more about how a [twitter book club works](https://science.mozilla.org/blog/how-do-twitter-book-clubs-work) but all you need is a twitter accound and to follow the [#mozreads](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23mozreads) hashtag. We'll be discussing Dear Data in the larger context of sharing data and open art practice, but you can bring whatever you'd like to the conversation.
