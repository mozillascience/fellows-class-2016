<b>Hello world</b> My name is Teon Brooks and I am PhD student at NYU in cognitive neuroscience. Soon I will be a researcher in The Center for Reproducible Neuroscience and Department of Psychology at Stanford University.

As a researcher, I am interested in understanding how the brain processes language via storage and retrieval and what exactly does this "mental dictionary" of words look like. I use a few pretty cool techniques:

I use a machine called an MEG, which stands for magnetoencephalogram. It kind of looks like Cerebro, and we use it to measure very, very small, like femto-Telsa (0.000000000001 T), magnetic fields that our brain produces when it does a task.

I also use eye-tracking equipment. This allows me to look at your eyes as they scan the world and take in information. I use it to understand how does the brain read written text so I look at the way you move your eyes from word to word, sometimes staying a short while or sometimes quickly hopping away to the next word.

I also work on developing software that allows us to take all this data in and make sense out of it. There are two major projects that I am working on: the MNE project and the OpenEXP project.

MNE is a community-based project for researchers and developers who are interested in analysis <b>M</b>EG  a<b>n</b>d <b>E</b>EG data (see what we did there ;) ).

The OpenEXP project is envisioned as a collection of projects to make science great again! Its core product, expfactory, founded Vanessa offers allows us to run a battery of psychology experiments on the interwebs. A smaller, related project, openexp, aims to build on this and jsPsych and create a desktop-friendly app for researchers and learner, alike. We want to build on this core product, and re-imagine how experimental psychology and cognitive science is taught. There are developing plans to redo introductory psychology with hands-on experiments, coding, and more.

I love teaching and I recently piloted a new workshop on DIY Cognitive Science. With my friend, Piya, and our awesome team of volunteer instructors, we taught a two-day workshop in Thailand on building eye-trackers and EEG headsets.

Follow along my adventure. My goal is to create opens-source software that help researchers get stuff done, learners get stuff learned, and bring science to everyone in an accessible way.
