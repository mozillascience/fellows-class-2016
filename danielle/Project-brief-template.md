# Project brief template 

# Part 1: From vision to core ideas and outcomes
>A project planning exercise.
>I've been trying to improve my strategy and get out of some project planning habits. This exercise pulls from Amira's [Women and Web session at Mozfest](https://medium.com/read-write-participate/women-web-strong-7e50f123311e#.4gds7zlt4), Open Canvas, Open Leadership materials, and conversations with my fellowship mentor Robin Champieux. I hope this exercise will help you with strategic planning for your projects!

## 1.1 Workflow:
>Danielle runs through the exercise. (10 min)
>Work individually through the prompts in Part 1. (20 min)
>Make a 1-2 minute pitch that involves the project's core ideas and outcomes. 
>Split into pairs and tell your partner. (10 min)
>Partner asks questions from Part 2.
>Hear your partner's pitch and ask questions. (10 min)
>Report back to the group about your experience with this exercise. (15 min)
>Complete Part 3 on your own!
>Send Danielle feedback about this session.

## 1.2 The Problem: 
### Describe the problem the project will address. (2-5 sentences) 

- Who are the agents or players involved and peripheral to the issue?
- What are the consequences of this problem?
 - locally, nationally, globally
- Who is not paying attention to this problem?
    
## 1.3 The Vision:
 
### How does the project address the problem? (2-5 sentences)

- What is the impact or change you hope to make?
- What is the value of the project?
 
### Who is the audience? (2-5 sentences)
>Describe the people who will use and/or participate in the project.

- What are their needs in order to participate in the project.
- Are there prerequisites for participation in the project.
- Will they participate in the formation of the project, if so, how?
- How will they access the project during formation and once it's complete.
- Write participant or user personas, if appropriate.

### Who/what resources already exist to address the problem? (2-5 sentences)

- What are the gaps in existing systems? 
- Why have other approaches failed?
- How is this approach special or different?

### What are the intended outcomes? (2-5 sentences)
>*Outcomes* are the change the project is intended to realize, as well as significant indicators of progress along the way. 
>Separate outcomes from *outputs*. For example, running a basic markdown class is an *output*, while students learning to write in markdown and incorporating it into their workflows is an *outcome*. 

- What does success look like for the project? 
- What results will this project achieve? 
- What will the project change or impact?
- How will you measure that change? (Put the short version here, see also Assessment section below to expand on this.)

## 1.4 External considerations:
>High level brainstorming on how the project fits in to priorities of your employer/funder, how it will interact with external people and resources. Save details (cost of food, etc) for Part 3.

### Fellowship or organization priorities (Bullet points)
> Do you work somewhere that has a strategic plan? You're going to need to talk about the project in the terms reflect what your organization values. List the priorities of your fellowship/job/organization that this project addresses.

- Add fellowship/job/organization themes here
- Open source
- Community building
- Open education
- Openly developed resource
- Open science
- Open web
- Open access
- Data sharing
- Open- friendly policy
- Cultural change 

### Who are the collaborators? (Bullet points)

- What role will each collaborator play?
- How will you communicate?
- What will motivate the collaborators to work with you and stay engaged?
- What makes you/collaborators uniquely positioned to solve the problem?

### What will define the completion of the project? (2-5 sentences)
> High level, go into detail here in section 3.

- How will the project be sustained?
  -Beyond 6 mo, beyond 1 yr, indefinitely?
- Will users/participants be involved in iteration and sustaining the project?

## 1.5 Assessment:
> How will you measure the success of the project?

- What outcomes do you hope to achieve?
 - What output is each outcome tied to?
 - How can these outcomes be measured?
- How will users assess the project?
- How will outside entities (funders, other institutions, colleagues) assess the project?
- Be sure to ask simple questions that get to the heart of the intended outcomes.
 - Did it work? (Rather than did it happen.)
 - How well is it working?
 
## 1.6 Core ideas: 
> Bullet point ideas that get to the heart of the project.
> Brainstorm here to get central concepts down to *2-3 core ideas*, high level concepts central to the project, possibly outcomes. 

- Impact/influence? 
- Inform/educate? 
- Facilitate/remove barriers? 
- Transform? What will be different? 
- What will people do differently?

## 1.7 The Pitch:
>Make a 1-2 minute pitch that explains to problem, and ties the project's core ideas to outcomes. 


----------------------

# Part 2: Partner feedback
>How clear are the project's core ideas? Can you push your partner to think outside of their box? 
>Is your partner addressing the root of the problem or do their plans address peripheral issues?
>The point of this is to get feedback before getting into the weeds of the practical and logistical details (that's Part 3, that you'll do on your own)!

- #Example:# How to the core ideas of a project designed for impact in an academic department translate into an informal meetup setting? Or an audience of highschool students? Or an audience of unemployed people? A group of work-at-home moms in another country? 

 - If the project won't translate to other enviornments or audience groups - why? 
 - Can you learn something about the project's core ideas by considering other enviornments or audience groups?
 - Can another approach get you closer to the project's core ideas and outcomes?

 - More sample questions:
  - How would this project translate to another part of the world?
  - How would this project translate to a different group of participants? Is there another way to measure the project outcomes?
  - Does this project make assumptions about participants?
  - Is the plan to measure impact attainable?

 ----------------------
# Part 3: Developing a Practical Plan
>Do this on your own!
  
## 3.1 What resources are required for the project to succeed?

- Money? 
- Time?
- Expertise? 
- Infrastructure?
- Permission?
- Other resources?


## 3.3 Process: How will the project unfold?
 > Write out, in a stream of consciousness style, how this project will unfold. Be as detailed as possible. What are the critical moments? What roadblocks are you likely to encounter? Use this exercise to help identify key milestones and potential issues. 
 
 - What are the outputs of the project? 
  - Tie each output to an outcome from earlier in the exercise. 

## 3.2 Milestones, roll out, and maintanance:
- How will you know when the project is done?
 - Is there a minimum viable versions of the project that can be rolled out?
 - Can the project be rolled out in parts?

- Expand here on how will the project be sustained?
  -Beyond 6 mo, beyond 1 yr, indefinitely?
- Will users/participants be involved in iteration and sustaining the project?

# 3.4 The timeline: 
> Using the process narrative from section 3.3 and targeted outcomes from section 1.3, break the project down into a series to sprints between now anda the end point. 
> Include dates, events, deadlines and specifics where possible.

- Example two week sprint:
 - List of activities, outputs, milestones
 - List of roadblocks/issues
 - List collaborators and their responsibilities
 - List resources needed for sprint
