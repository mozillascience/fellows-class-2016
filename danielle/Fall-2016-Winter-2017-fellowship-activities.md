As part of the 2016 Mozilla Fellows for Science program, I completed/participated in the following September 2016 - February 2017.

The Fellowship is structured in [three parts](https://github.com/mozillascience/fellows-class-2016/blob/master/roadmap.md). I've just completed the exploration phase (September 2016 - December 2016). Below you'll find an overview of what I have been working on and some of the projects I plan to prototype over the next few months.

>Building community, beyond just expanding one's local network, enables scientists to gain exposure to new tools, workflows, and perspective from other technical communities.  Academic research, particulary the branch of wet lab biology I come from, does not tend to embrace open-source tools and ideals. Expanding my scientific community to include people from across the scientific spectrum, and the open source community has enhanced my productivity and helped me develop leadership and project management skills. 
>
>For example, in September I collaborated with [Women in Science Portland](http://wisportland.weebly.com/) and [ChickTech PDX](https://portland.chicktech.org/) to host a three part workshop on [career development and negotiation for women in technical fields](https://science.mozilla.org/blog/reflections-on-women-in-stem) with [Jessica Williams](http://superwomanproject.com/). This workshop series brought ecologists, cyber security experts, data scientists, neuroscientists, software developers, project managers, actuaries, postdocs, PhD candidates, bioinformatitans, and other technical professional together in a welcoming environment to talk about our careers goals.

>In October, I collaborated with an incredible team of scientists, OHSU librarians, engineers, and coders to produce [Science Hack Day Portland](http://portland.sciencehackday.org/) in October. [Jenny Molloy](https://twitter.com/jenny_molloy?lang=en) spoke about hacking hardware, [Dietrich Ayala](https://twitter.com/dietrich) spoke about harnessing the power of the internet of things for people rather than corporate gain, and [Hack Oregon](http://www.hackoregon.org/) founder [Catherine Nikolovski](https://twitter.com/cat_nikolovski?lang=en) talked about civic tech and hacking open government data. Support from the OHSU Library brought speakers and sustainance. Mozilla donated [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) and hardware for the event, and the indespensible [Alex Challey](https://twitter.com/alexchally) of Portland State University's Science Support Shop brought along three 3-D printers and managed the design workstation for people to prototype on site. More on the teams and projects can be found [here](https://storify.com/rchampieux/science-hack-day-portland). This Spring, building on what we learned at Science Hack Day, I'm partnering with Robin Champieux, Letisha Wyatt, and the OHSU Library to host a Hack your Microscope event designed for OHSU students and researchers to campus.

>As a part of my Fellowship with Mozilla Science Lab, I joined the [Science](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/fellowships/fellows), [Web](https://advocacy.mozilla.org/en-US/open-web-fellows/fellows2016), and [Journalism](https://opennews.org/what/fellowships/info/) fellows at the [Mozilla Festival](https://mozillafestival.org/) in London in late October. At Mozfest, I presented a talk: "The open revolution is science and why it needs you" and participated in inspiring workshops and discussions, including [Christie Bahlai's Reproducible Quantitive Methods course](https://cbahlai.github.io/rqm-template/), simultaneously learning JavaScript and critical concepts of evolution and genetics with [Marcel SalathÃ©](https://www.edx.org/course/nature-code-biology-javascript-epflx-nic1-0x), and buidling skills for collaboration with GitHub and RStudio with [Anna Krystalli](http://annakrystalli.github.io/). 
>
>After Mozfest, I traveled to Washington DC for [OpenCon 2016](http://www.opencon2016.org/updates/). Kirstie Whitaker and I developed a website called [Open Advice](https://kirstiejane.github.io/OpenAdvice/), which collects "agony aunt" style questions and answers to issues facing researchers who want to work openly. At OpenCon, we gathered a group of contributors together and worked on the site. The work is onging, and we hope to make a resource for the OHSU community, so feel free to [contribute a question or an answer](https://github.com/KirstieJane/OpenAdvice)!

>OpenCon's unique Advocacy Day matches conference atendees with representatives or interest groups to advocate for policies to support open science. This year, advocacy day took place just six days after the presidential election and the mood in DC was unsettled. I joined a group of [students and librarians from around Oregon](https://twitter.com/Neurosarda/status/798242797103026176) and met with [Ron Wyden's staff](https://opencon2016.sched.com/event/8uTk/advocacy-meeting-senator-ron-wyden-d-or?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) to discuss the [Fair Access to Science and Technology Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Access_to_Science_and_Technology_Research_Act) (FASTR). I also lead a meeting of 20 OpenCon attendees at the [National Academy of Sciences](https://opencon2016.sched.com/event/8uTZ/advocacy-meeting-national-academy-of-sciences?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) (NAS) with Dr. George Strawn, Board Director for the Policy and Global Affairs Division at the National Academy of Sciences, and Dr. Marcia McNutt, President of the National Academy of Sciences. We advocated for data sharing and open access, more support for early career researchers, and voiced our concerns about diversity and inclusion in the sciences.
>
>I then returned to Portland in December to defend my dissertation. I also gave a talk at the [Coding for Science and Society Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Dat-Meetup/events/235968044/) on the resources that Mozilla Science lab is developing for scientists and the ways in which we build community.
>
>Many new projects are in the works for 2017. [OHSU Code Club](https://github.com/daniellecrobinson/OHSU-Code-Club) held its inagural meeting in January and thanks to collaborations with the DMICE and the BioDSP organizers, Python summer club organizers, and the OHSU Library we already have a full schedule of workshops and informal work-along meetings. About 20 people attended out first meeting, more than half of whom were from basic science departments and had never written a line of code! Code Club will focus on helping beginners at OHSU learn basic coding skills and open source tools in a friendly enviornment, as well as building connections between OHSU students in different departments through student-lead workshops and skill-share sessions.

>I also joined the organizing committees of several conferences and initiatives. 
>
>[CSV,Conf,v3](https://csvconf.com/) will take place this May in Portland, after two years in Berlin. This conference offers the oppportunity to network with leaders and innovators in science, journalism, policy, and software developmentand to discuss diverse perspectives on open data and tools. You are invited to submitting a talk by February 15, 2017!  
>
>[Radian Data](http://radiandata.com/) is a collaboration between myself, Robin Champieux at the OHSU Library, Sara Mannheimer, and other librarians at the Montana State University Library to build a platform that enables curation, centralization, and discovery of resources for open data practitioners, educators, and enthusiasts on the open web. This OHSU-lead project will fill a community need by helping researchers, students, and librarians connect to the best resources on data topics and build cross-disciplinary connections. This project is supported by the Sloan Foundation and FORCE11.
>
>[Scientists Speaking Up](http://futureofresearch.org/campaign-scientists-speaking-up/) is a campaign support early career researchers efforts to create an inclusive future for science and insure that socities are standing up for science in an era of "alternative facts", by advocating inside scientific societies. This campaign supported by the early career advocacy group [Future of Research](http://futureofresearch.org/).
>
>This February I am helping to organize Portland's first [Data Rescue](http://calagator.org/events/1250471401) event. This event includes a JSON tutorial for beginners and will help participants understand where open data lives, how open data in structured, and build skills in data documentation and archiving. This event will prep attendees to join the Data Jamboree and OHSU Library supported [Open Data Day](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/open-data-day-portland-tickets-31370043645) in March 2017.
